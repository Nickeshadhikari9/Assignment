    <h1>PORTFOLIO</h1>
    <h2>My Favourite Hobby</h2>
    <p>My favorite hobby is listening to music, particularly Nepali slow pop and love songs as well as soul songs and
        indie music. I find it really enjoyable to immerse myself in these genres. I prefer to listen to music alone
        because it allows me to fully connect with the songs and lyrics. I've always had a deep interest in learning to
        play the guitar. Attending live music performances is something I truly love, especially when I'm familiar with
        the artist. There's an incredible energy and excitement when watching a performance in person. Music has a
        powerful effect on my emotions. When I'm feeling stressed, listening to music instantly energizes me and helps me feel more
        positive. On the other hand, when I'm going through emotional moments, music has a calming and soothing effect
        on me. One of my routines is going for a run in the mornings, usually alone at 4 o'clock. Listening to music
        while running helps me feel refreshed and rejuvenated. It enhances my running experience and keeps me motivated.
        Although I haven't been able to learn the guitar yet, I'm still passionate about music, and it remains my
        favorite hobby. </p>
    <b>what matters most is engaging in activities that bring me happiness, relaxation, and fulfillment, and music
        definitely accomplishes that for me.</b><br>
    <i>I believe that hobbies can evolve over time, so I'm open to exploring other aspects of music, such as singing or
        discovering different genres.</i><br>
    <u>Immersed in the soulful melodies of Nepali slow pop, I find solace and inspiration as I listen to music alone,
        letting it energize and relax me, even while chasing my morning runs.</u><br>
    <s>With music as my companion, I embark on a journey of self-discovery and endless possibilities.</s><br>
