    <p align="justify">HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a fundamental language used in web development to structure
        and present
        content on the internet. It serves as the backbone of web pages, defining the elements and layout of a document.
        HTML uses a tag-based system where specific tags are used to enclose different parts of a webpage, such as
        headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. These tags provide structure and semantics to the content,
        allowing browsers to interpret and render the page correctly. HTML also supports attributes, which provide
        additional information or modify the behavior of elements. With HTML, developers can create a hierarchy of
        elements, apply styling through CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and add interactivity through JavaScript. It plays
        a crucial role in creating accessible, well-organized, and visually appealing websites that can be viewed and
        interacted with across various devices and browsers.CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a powerful language used in
        web development to control the presentation and visual appearance of HTML documents. It works in conjunction
        with HTML to define how elements should be styled and displayed on a webpage. By separating the structure (HTML)
        from the style (CSS), developers can achieve a clear separation of concerns and easily apply consistent design
        across multiple pages.CSS operates by selecting elements or groups of elements and applying various styling properties to them. This
        is done using selectors, which target specific elements based on their tags, classes, IDs, or other attributes.
        CSS offers a wide range of styling options, including controlling colors, fonts, spacing, layout, borders,
        backgrounds, and more.<br><br>

        One of the key features of CSS is its cascading nature, where multiple styles can be applied to an element based
        on specificity and order of declaration. This allows for easy maintenance and global changes by modifying a
        single CSS rule that propagates throughout the entire website. CSS also supports responsive design, enabling developers to create layouts that adapt and respond to different
        screen sizes and devices. This is achieved through media queries, which allow different styles to be applied
        based on factors such as screen width, height, orientation, or resolution. In addition to inline CSS styles, CSS can be defined in a separate file (usually with a .css extension) and
        linked to the HTML document using the <link>` tag. This external CSS file can be reused across multiple pages, enhancing consistency and ease of
        maintenance. CSS is continuously evolving, with new features and capabilities being added over time. Preprocessors like Sass
        or Less offer additional functionalities such as variables, mixins, and nesting, making CSS code more modular
        and maintainable. CSS frameworks and libraries, such as Bootstrap or Foundation, provide ready-to-use styles and
        components to expedite development. Overall, CSS empowers developers to transform the appearance of HTML documents, creating visually appealing,
        responsive, and user-friendly websites. It plays a crucial role in shaping the look and feel of web pages and
        contributes to a positive user experience.
