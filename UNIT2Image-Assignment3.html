    <h1>Image in Marquee</h1>
    <p>The marquee element in HTML is used to create a scrolling or moving effect for text or images on a web page.
            While it was popular in the past, the marquee element is now considered obsolete and not recommended for
                use in modern web development. It has been deprecated in HTML5, and its usage is discouraged due to
                accessibility and usability concerns. However, if you still want to create a scrolling effect for images, it is recommended to use CSS
                animations or JavaScript libraries that offer more control and flexibility. CSS animations can be
                achieved using the @keyframes rule and the animation property to define the movement and duration of the
                animation. JavaScript libraries like jQuery or GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) provide robust
                animation capabilities, including scrolling effects for images.</p>
